Description:
    The curatedMetagenomicData R/Bioconductor package requires preprocessing
    of outputs from its high load pipeline that are not needed by users. The
    curatedMetagenomicDataPipeline package contains these functions to avoid
    their inclusion in the user facing curatedMetagenomicData package.
